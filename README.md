Hey, there! I'm Frodo (no it's not my real name and I won't tell you my real name. Stop asking. I still love you, though). My real name is Mohamed.

I'm an indie game developer from the best and greatest country in the damn world and universe Egypt (sarcasm warning). I mainly make games without game engines. I use my own tools and programs to help me make these games. Since I'm mainly a programmer, the art of the games is not all that great. But I'm trying to learn as I go along... so leave me alone. 

My main programming language is C++. Not because I love C++ or anything, rather, I've been living deep in Bjarne's dungeon and he's been forcing me to use C++.  But, beyond that, I do mainly use Raylib or OpenGL depending on the game I'm making.

What I lack in professional experience, I make up for in extreme procrastination. I'm a very prominent member of the procrastination community.

I hope this doesn't turn you off from playing my amazing artistic games.
