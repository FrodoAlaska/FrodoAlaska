Hey, there! I'm Frodo (no it's not my real name and I won't tell you my real name. Stop asking. I still love you, though). My real name is Mohamed.

I'm an indie game developer from the best and greatest country in the damn world and universe Egypt (sarcasm warning). I mainly make games without game engines. I use my own tools and small programs to help me make these games. If you ask me why I took this approach, I would say it's my own curiosity and love for the low-level programming world. I can probably write a poem about that but I'll spare you the emotions. Since I'm primarily a programmer, the art of the games is not all that great. But I'm trying to learn as I go along... so leave me alone. 

My main programming language is C++. Not because I love C++ or anything, rather, I've been living deep in Bjarne's dungeon and he's been forcing me to use C++.  But, beyond that, I mainly use Raylib or OpenGL/GLFW depending on the game I'm making.

What I lack in professional experience, I make up for in extreme procrastination. I'm a very prominent member of the procrastination community.

I hope this doesn't prevent you from playing my amazing artistic games.
